# Lupoenpietra-3D

A GZDooM mod focusing on making a Wolfenstein like experience, but set in Italy.

Set more so in the modern MachineGames timeline rather than the classic Id
Software timeline. It will act as a supplementary to the Wolfestein-era for
ProjectBrutality, since everyone likes just doing Wolfenstein and Germany over
and over.
